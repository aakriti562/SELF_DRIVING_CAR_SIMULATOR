# SELF DRIVING CAR-SIMULATOR

Self-driving cars have emerged as a transformative technology, promising safer and more
efficient transportation. Simulators play a crucial role in testing autonomous driving
algorithms, allowing developers to assess performance in diverse scenarios. This project
introduces a self-driving car simulator concept that eschews external libraries, relying
solely on deep learning and neural networks
